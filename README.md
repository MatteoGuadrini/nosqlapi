# pynosql

_pynosql_ is a library for building standard NOSQL python libraries.

## Introduction

This library is defined to encourage similarity between Python modules used to access NOSQL databases. 
In this way, I hope for consistency that leads to more easily understood modules, code that generally gets more 
portability across databases and a broader scope of database connectivity from Python.

This document describes the Python NOSQL database API specification.
