Build a library
===============

In this section we will build a **NOSQL API** compliant library, using the ``nosqlapi`` library.
We will first build the core objects that will allow us to connect and operate with our database.

.. note::
    The following example is designed for a NOSQL database of the Document type; by changing the application logic of
    the various methods in the classes you can build a library for another type of NOSQL database in the same way.
    The procedures are the same.
